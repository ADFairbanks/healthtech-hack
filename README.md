## Overview

Mental health practitioners spend time and limited resources seeing patients that could have ordinarily been tended to by non-specialized care workers. As a result, 24.7% of all adults with a mental illness are not able to receive the treatment they need. The system is so overwhelmed that patients have to wait months to access a clinician. Not everyone knows the range of help that is available to them, Social workers, Behavior health technicians, Councilors, Etc. Our solution is by reducing unneeded visits by identifying the severity of the patientâ€™s needs and the kind of care that that would be most beneficial. This is done with an adaptive questionnaire a person would take, populating the recommend clinical care and educating the patient on the alternative method. Furthermore, it will provide practitioners with the screening information so that they can make a diagnosis in a more timely manner.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
